# WDL Usage and Adoption Survey Report  

## Introduction  
The WDL Usage and Adoption Survey aimed to gather insights and feedback from the WDL user community. The survey received responses from professionals primarily based in North America, working in academia and the biotech/pharma industries. This report summarizes the key findings and trends observed from the survey responses.  

## Key Findings  

### Shift to Cloud Platforms  
There has been a notable shift towards using cloud platforms for running WDL workflows. **75% of respondents** indicated that they primarily run their workflows on cloud platforms such as GCP, AWS, and Azure. This trend reflects the growing preference for scalable and flexible computing solutions in bioinformatics.  

### Multi-Cloud Deployments  
Multi-cloud deployments are becoming increasingly popular among WDL users. **60% of respondents** reported using multiple cloud platforms to meet their computational and data availability needs. This approach allows for greater flexibility and resilience in managing workflows.  

### Open Science and Collaboration  
Open Science is highly valued within the WDL community. **85% of respondents** emphasized the importance of transparency and collaboration in advancing scientific research. The survey highlighted the need for more best practices guides, example workflows, and tutorials to support the community.  

### Workflow Development and Validation  
Most users write their WDL workflows manually, with **70% using tools** like MiniWDL, Womtool, and Dockstore for validation and linting. Python, Bash, and R are the most commonly used programming languages with WDL. The quality of WDL documentation is generally rated as good, but **65% of respondents** expressed a demand for more comprehensive resources.  

### Community Engagement  
Engagement with the WDL community is occasional, with **55% of respondents** using platforms like GitHub Discussions and WDL Slack. Users expressed a desire for more opportunities to connect and share knowledge with fellow WDL users.  

### Future of WDL  
The future of WDL is seen with mixed opinions:  
- **40%** of users expect it to stay the same.  
- **30%** foresee increasing usage.  
- **30%** foresee decreasing usage.  

Desired features for future versions include:  
- Better support for scattering with dynamic load balancing.  
- Improved linters and real-time debuggers for IDEs.  
- More comprehensive conditional support.  

### Comparison with Other Workflow Languages  
WDL is seen as restrictive and tricky for pipeline developers but powerful and cross-platform compatible for end-users. **25% of users** are considering switching to other workflow languages like Nextflow and Snakemake due to community trends and perceived advantages.

## Future of WDL
The [WDL Governance Comitte](https://github.com/openwdl/governance/blob/main/README.md) is considering this feedback. As
part of our discussions we are aiming to increase community engagment over the next few months through [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openwdl/shared_invite/zt-ctmj4mhf-cFBNxIiZYs6SY9HgM9UAVw) and [WDL git repo](https://github.com/openwdl/).
